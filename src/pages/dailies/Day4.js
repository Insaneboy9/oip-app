            <strong>Today, we decided to use storyboarding for our prototype, as it allows us to follow the userâ€™s journey and imagine potential issues with the solution. Despite the low-fidelity prototype, we were able to identify logistical challenges with our suggested solution and a gap in our stakeholder analysis.</strong>

              We realized that the QR code has to be able to withstand damage and still be usable.

              Additionally, the use of QR codes may pose a security risk as it could be pasted over with a QR code leading to a malicious website if it is not frequently checked on.
            </li>
            <li>
              We also realized that we left out two stakeholders in our previous analysis, which are everyday people who have no awareness of the Annexe Communities or their work, and people who partake in geocaching.

          </ul>

            Apart from prototyping, we designed some tests for our potential solutions, which we will use to evaluate the improved prototypes.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-5 font-playfair text-base">
            Over the weekend, we will create more prototypes, potentially using different methods of prototyping to critique our potential solutions thoroughly, before presenting Jane with our most promising prototype.
